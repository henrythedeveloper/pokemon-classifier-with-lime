# Pokémon Classifier with LIME Explanations - Dependencies
#
# Here’s the rundown on what each package does for us:
# - streamlit: our main app framework, handles all the interactive web elements
# - Pillow: deals with image processing so we can upload and work with Pokémon images
# - torch: the core library for PyTorch, powers our Vision Transformer model
# - transformers: from Hugging Face, gives us the ViT model and all the tools we need with it
# - lime: generates explanations to show why the model makes certain predictions
# - scikit-image: for creating image segments (aka superpixels) that help with LIME explanations
# - numpy: does the heavy lifting on numerical operations throughout the app
# - pandas: keeps prediction data organized and display-ready
# - scikit-learn: supports LIME and other machine learning utilities
# - stqdm: adds progress bars in Streamlit to track LIME explanation generation
