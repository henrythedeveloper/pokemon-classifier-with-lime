# Model Explained

## Vision Transformer (ViT)
The model used in this project is a Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on Pokémon images. The ViT architecture is excellent for image classification tasks due to its use of attention mechanisms, which help it "focus" on specific regions in an image.

## Dataset
The model currently has limited data on newer-generation Pokémon, so predictions might be less accurate for those. An update with additional training data is planned.

## Model Limitations
This model performs well on older Pokémon generations but may have reduced accuracy with newer species.
