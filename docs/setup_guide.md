# Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the Pokémon Classifier project.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended to use `venv` or Anaconda to manage dependencies.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/henrythedeveloper/pokemon-classifier-with-lime.git
   cd pokemon-classifier-with-lime
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Configure any environment variables needed by copying `.env.example` to `.env`.

4. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try setting up a new virtual environment.
- If `streamlit` fails to launch, check for errors in the terminal and consult the project’s README.
